# Code-Challenge-Interactive-Shopping-List

The objective is to develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## How It Works

- You insert title of the list, for example, Groceries.
- Then add the items that you would like to add to the shopping list, for example, Milk, Bread, Eggs...
- Once you have purchased the items, you check them and the application will cross it.
- In case you want something of the list, press the x button remove it
